#+TITLE: Steps for running AI eval tests

This directory has promptfoo-based tests for AI models.
The instructions below are for a Windows OS but they should work with
"brew install" instead of "winget install" for Mac OS also.

* Prerequisites

Install node.js to get npm.

#+begin_src
  winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
#+end_src

Then, install promptfoo.

#+begin_src
  npm install -g promptfoo
#+end_src

* Models

If you want to use a local implementation of an LLM, you should
install Ollama and pull a model. In the example below, I pulled the 8B
Llama3 model.

#+begin_src
  winget install Ollama.Ollama

  # Note that this is the 8B model (5 GB file size)
  ollama pull llama3
#+end_src

* Running tests

Run the tests as follows.

#+begin_src
  promptfoo eval --config basic_local_llama3_tests.yaml
#+end_src

This will run the tests in the named YAML file.
